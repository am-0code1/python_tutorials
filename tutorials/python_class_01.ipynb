    "\n",
    "\\- In Python, **class** refers to a _design plan_ that you use to create **object(s)**.\n",
    "In the design plan you specify all the properties (**data attributes**) and functionalities (**methods**) the objects may possess once created.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- Attributes of an object include its **data attributes** (describing properties) and **methods** (enabling specific functionalities).\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- A _method_ is a _function_ belonging to an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- Once a class definition is executed and completed with no error, a **class object** is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- You can call the **class object** (_class instantiation_) to create a **class instance object** (or simply **object**). \n",
    "\n",
    "\\- **Class object** is _instantiable_, while **class instance object** is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- You can use the Python built-in _dir_ function to list all valid attributes of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- **Class object** supports two types of operations: _attribute references_ and _instantiation_, while **class instance object** only supports the _attribute references_.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- You can reference both _data attributes_ and _methods_. \n",
    "\n",
    "\\- The way that _class instantiation_ works is very straightforward: you call the **class object** and it returns an _instance_ of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- When referencing a _method_ of a **class object**, the corresponding **function object** will be returned. By referencing a _method_ of a **class instance object**, on the other side, the corresponding **method object** will be returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- When a **class instance object** (pear) calls its **method object** (grow), a search would be done on the **class object** (tree) for the corresponding **function object** (grow). If found, the **function object** (grow) belonging to the **class object** (tree) is called with the **class instance object** (pear) as the first parameter. For example, the call ***pear.grow()*** is equivalent to ***tree.grow(pear)***.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\-  A _method_ can change the data attributes of the **class instance object** calling it; not any other object, but the object calling the method **itself!!!** So, it makes sense why people adopted the convention of naming the first parameter of method ***self***, although you can use any other valid name, similar to a parameter of any other function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- You can use the \\_\\_init\\_\\_ method to customize the initial state of each object upon its creation.\n",
