    "An **anonymous function** in Python is a function defined using the keyword **lambda** without any name, as opposed to a normal function that is defined using the keyword **def** with a name to be called later. Because of using the keyword lambda, an anonymous function is also called **lambda function**.\n",

The two unique features of being **anonymous** and having **only one expression** make the lambda function a perfect tool for the cases that you need to call a relatively simple expression (due to having only one expression) from only one place in your whole code (due to being anonymous). Upon being called, the lambda function operates on given argument(s) and return output(s).\n",

    "We provided several examples demonstrating that lambda function can lead to a neat, short, and inline style of coding under some specific circumstances, particularly when you need to perform fairly simple operations in one part of your code. It can also be helpful to pass a simple function to a higher order function like the Python built-in **map** function, or the **apply** method from **pandas** library. However, we emphasized to not be obsessed with lambda function! Use if for simple cases that one single expression suffices to describe the desired operation. You can always use normal function for complex operations.\n",
