    "Like many other programing languages, Python allows function recursion.\n",
    "It should be noted that following the logic behind the implemented function recursion may not be trivial.\n",
    "One of the consequences, amongst others, is that a programmer may write a code that leads to an infinite loop for some input data.\n",
    "However, when the conditions are met and the concept is implemented properly, function recursion enables writing concise and clean codes."
