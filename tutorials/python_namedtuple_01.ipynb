    "Have you ever wished to have a dictionary that enables the _slicing_ operation similar to a list or tuple?! \n",
    "\n",
    "Or, maybe, having an iterable allowing _slicing_ and, at the same time, offering access to items from keys similar to a dictionary?!\n",
    "\n",
    "If so, you are in the right place, since we are going to discuss a cool datatype in Python called ***named tuple*** (tuple with named fields) that simultaneously supports access to items via index, similar to tuples and list, and access to items via keys, similar to a dictionary. \n",

    "### Scope of tutorial and what you learn\n",

    "In this tutorial, we discuss a specialized datatype called _'named tuple'_ that can be created using the function ***namedtuple*** from the module **collections**.\n",
    "We start with introducing the basics and the need to have such a specialized datatype.\n",
    "We will then discuss the parameters of the function ***namedtuple***, and provide some examples demonstrating how you can access the items of the newly-created _named tuple_ datatype through both 1. index (like tuple), and 2. key (like dictionary).\n",

    "## Python _namedtuple_ | basics\n",
    "<font color=\"darkred\">What is namedtuple in Python?</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "**<font color=\"darkgreen\">In Python, \"namedtuple\" is a function from the module collections enabling us to create a specialized container datatype called \"named tuple\" (Tuple with Named Fields) that borrows some useful features from the built-in datatypes: \"dictionary\" and \"tuple\".</font>**\n",
    "\n",
    "I know, it is exciting! Let me explain the pertinent concepts first.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the module **collections** provides with implementation of specialized container datatypes as an alternative to built-in containers such as ***list, set, tuple, and dict***.\n",
    "One of such specialized container datatypes is _named tuple_, _i.e._ **Tuple with Named Fields**, that can be created using the **namedtuple** function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **namedtuple** function, therefore, is used to create a class for objects consisting of some data attributes with no custom methods. Feel free to see our other [tutorial on class, object, data attributes, and methods](https://soardeepsci.com/python-class/) for more information about the class and object concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the _named tuple_ datatype mainly consists of data attributes, it is well suited to be used as a database record.\n",
    "\n",
    "More importantly, the _named tuple_ datatype offers both slicing (like \\[3:7\\]) and key-value access (it has _keys_); think of it as a combination of dictionary and tuple.\n",
    "Now, it should make more sense to you when we say that the **collections** module provides with implementation of ***specialized container datatypes***.\n",
    "\n",
    "**<font color=\"navy\">OK, that is awesome, but how to use the namedtuple function to create such a cool datatype?!</font>**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **namedtuple** function has two [positional-or-keyword parameters](https://soardeepsci.com/python-function-argument-parameter): \"typename\" and \"field_names\".\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=\"green\">What does the \"typename\" parameter do?!</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out when you call **namedtuple**, a ***tuple*** (actually a subclass) is returned, the name of which is specified by the \"typename\" parameter.\n",
    "There are some nuances about the naming and the parameter _typename_ that I will get to later.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=\"green\">What does the \"field_names\" parameter do?!</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter \"field_names\" is used to create the fields of the returned tuple-like object upon calling **namedtuple**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter \"field_names\" takes a sequence of strings such as \\['name', 'id', 'age'\\] to specify the fields of the new datatype. \n",
    "To make your life slightly easier (!), you can alternatively pass a single string separating field names by whitespace and/or commas, _e.g._ 'name id age', or 'name, id, age'.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create **tuple** (subclass) objects with **named fields** by using the factory function **namedtuple**.\n",

    "\\- In Python, the function ***namedtuple*** from module **collections** allows you to create a new datatype called _named tuple_, which is basically a **tuple with named fields**.\n",

    "\\- Since the newly created class _named tuple_ has mainly data attributes without custom methods, it is well suited for creating database records.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- You can instantiate the newly created datatype _named tuple_ to create as many objects as you want.\n",

We provided some examples to show how one can access the items of the _named tuple_ datatype through both 1. index (like tuple), and 2. keys (like dictionary). Importantly, we presented some nuances related to naming classes, which led to some recommendations for the parameter _typename_ from the function ***namedtuple***.\n",
